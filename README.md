# Exploring the integration of random forest and artificial somatic marker in the context of on-demand passenger transport 

The aim is to implement an artificial somatic marker within a machine learning technique in order to analyze its effects on decision making in the field of transport on demand.

Seeks to implement the use of artificial somatic marker within
of a machine learning technique in order to identify if it has effects on the decision making in the field of transport on demand. 
Transport on demand represents a particular context of decision making, as it makes the origin and destination of passengers, the routes of approach to the point of origin and the route of travel to the final destination more flexible. 
Based on the above, an artificial somatic marker is designed and incorporated into a machine learning technique called random forest. An algorithm based on Dijkstra's proposal is used to generate transport routes in urban areas. Whose simulation will include the elaboration of a matrix of points representing locations; implementation of the simulation scenario without and with the use of an artificial somatic marker in the machine learning technique.
