# Exploring the integration of random forest and artificial somatic marker in the context of on-demand passenger transport 

The aim is to implement an artificial somatic marker within a machine learning technique in order to analyze its effects on decision making in the field of transport on demand.

Seeks to implement the use of artificial somatic marker within
of a machine learning technique in order to identify if it has effects on the decision making in the field of transport on demand. 
Transport on demand represents a particular context of decision making, as it makes the origin and destination of passengers, the routes of approach to the point of origin and the route of travel to the final destination more flexible. 
Based on the above, an artificial somatic marker is designed and incorporated into a machine learning technique called random forest. An algorithm based on Dijkstra's proposal is used to generate transport routes in urban areas. Whose simulation will include the elaboration of a matrix of points representing locations; implementation of the simulation scenario without and with the use of an artificial somatic marker in the machine learning technique. 

## Additional notes 

The scripts contain the following codes, which must be executed in the order described below: 


1. Distance and georeferenced points matrix: random points are generated and a geocoding and distance matrix in time and kilometers of the points generated with the Google Maps API is made

2. Adjacency matrix - Dijkstra: Adjacency matrixes are generated for each profile, to generate routes with Dijkstra's algorithm.

3. Simulation with and without artificial somatic markings: The simulation scenario is carried out with and without the use of an artificial somatic marker in the on-demand passenger transport domain.
